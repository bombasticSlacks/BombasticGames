Line? is a fast GM-less storytelling game about trying to stage a play, except, you don't remember rehearsing. Interchangeably take the role of actors and tech in this fast, silly game about trying to tell a story together. Line? features a simple set of actions that players can do, quick rules for getting started, and only requires a single six sided dice.
